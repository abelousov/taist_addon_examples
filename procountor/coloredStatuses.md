Addon allows assigning different colors to different types of documents and their states to make working with lots of documents faster and easier.

Except "fixed" statuses there is also an "Overdue" status for document with due date in the past and status different from "Paid" or "Invalidated".

*To be done:*
  * custom company-wide colors for statuses
  * custom personal colors overriding company-wide colors
