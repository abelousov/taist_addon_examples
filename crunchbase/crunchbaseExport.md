## Current state: working prototype
Addon now exports company data to shared table in Google Docs - just to show how it works.
It surely can export data to private tables or to local files, add new tags and saved searches to Crunchbase, and more.
Just suggest your ideas in discussion below - I will choose most popular to implement.

### How to try
* go to any company profile - "Export" button appears on the right side of company profile page
* it exports company data to [Google doc table](https://docs.google.com/a/tai.st/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At6Ryl-W8CwadHRhTU5TcjRUcEtFb0dpQWRxV0ZvTHc)
