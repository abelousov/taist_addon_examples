### Workflow:
* task owner sees button "On Approval" - it adds "[OnApproval]" to task name, so task author gets notification about task name change;
* after that task owner sees two buttons:
  * "Approve" closes the task and adds "[Approved]" to its title;
  * "Decline" adds "[Declined]" so task owner is notified and can continue working on task, and button "On Approval" is visible again;

### Filters:
* filters group "Approval" is added to filters panel;
* these filters can be saved to widgets just like native ones.
